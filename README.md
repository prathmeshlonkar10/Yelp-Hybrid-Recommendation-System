# Yelp Hybrid Recommendation System

The recommendation system uses item-based collaborative filtering along with the Model-based recommendation system. 
The predictions of these 2 recommendation systems are then combined using the weighted hybrid recommendation system.
I decided to use model-based CF as the primary recommender because it gave me better performance over the item-based CF.
I have added additional 11 user features from the user.json dataset, and also considered the features from tip.json dataset.
